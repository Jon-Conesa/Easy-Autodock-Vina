# Easy-Autodock-Vina

An approach to computational biophysics for everyone. You don't need to know anything about computers, just follow the instructions.

What is Autodock Vina? Autodock Vina is a biocomputational program that calculates the binding of certain biomolecules. Usually, Autodock Vina predicts the binding of a large macromolecule (like a protein) and other smaller molecules. 

## Introduction

In my final research proejct of high school I stumbled upon computational biophysics, especifically with Autodock Vina. Now, I am pretty computer nerd guy: I love coding, I know how to code in python, I learnt how to use ubuntu's bash, etc...

However, when I tried to use Autodock Vina, I found it to be really difficult. You have to manage enormous quantities of information, you do have to know bash, and on top of that Autodock Vina's webpage is a little bit old.
